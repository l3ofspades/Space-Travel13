# Space-Travel Application

## Overview
Space-Travel is a React application for managing spacecrafts and planets. Users can view spacecraft details, add new spacecrafts, decommission existing ones, and dispatch spacecrafts between planets. The app demonstrates React fundamentals, state management, routing, forms, and testing with React Testing Library.

## Folder Structure
